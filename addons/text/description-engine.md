Use it to perform *docker build*, *docker run*, *docker-compose up* and *docker swarm join*. For using *docker-machine*, please ensure your Jelastic account has valid [public SSH keys](https://docs.jelastic.com/ssh-add-key) attached before running the installation. For *docker swarm init*, use auto-scalable Docker Swarm cluster from the [dedicated package](https://github.com/jelastic-jps/docker-native/tree/master/docker-swarm).
